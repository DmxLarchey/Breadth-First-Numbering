******************
File bft_spec.v:
******************

By default, cosmetic changes (like auto -> assumption) are integrated

Require Import does not have php anymore but utils is split in several files

line 116, I did keep firstorder to instanciate instead of exists because
the introduced variable name x0 might clash with previously introduced
fresh names (? inntro patterns)

line 196, the infix "~p" is now defined in list_utils.v

******************
File bt.v
******************

All the changes integrated

Removed the dependent induction principle for btb which is not needed anymore

******************
File php.v
******************

Line 20, no need to give an implicit type to p which is not used anymore
Line 22, incl_cons_linv moved to list_utils.v, structured proof is integrated
Line 29, same for incl_app_rinv 
Line 66-63, incl_pres_perm_left and incl_pres_perm_right moved to
       list_utils.v and renamed to perm_incl_left and perm_incl_right

list_length_rect removed and replaced by new tactic induction on l as IHl with measure (length l)

Line 73, Section Permutation_tools moved to list_utils.v
Line 90, did not integrate r m for Implicit Type. I make the
   following remark concerning the Implicit Type directive.

Remark: I view the Implicit Type directive as an indication for the 
       type-checker (unification), not as an indication for the human 
       reader. So I give the minimal indication that allows type-checking. 
       I think the human reader is generally more able to guess the type 
       than the type-checker.

Line 100, perm_in_head now in list_utils.v with updates from RM

Line 114, list_prefix now in list_utils.v but a much shorter one line 
       proof is given as an instance of the more general list_length_split.

Line 144, list_has_dup_app_right integrates RM updates

Line 151, list_hd_eq_perm integrates RM updates but in *renamed* perm_list_has_dup

Line 171, incl_right_cons_choose moved in list_utils.v with RM updates

Line 172, repeat_choice_two rewritten with the inductive "Forall (eq x) m" 
          (I find it more readable) and the proof is adapted. 

Line 197, incl_right_cons_incl_or_lhd_or_perm integrates RM updates

There is a new lemma called incl_left_right_php to factorize/flatten the proof 
      of the generalized PHP length_le_and_incl_implies_dup_or_perm

Line 216, the proof of length_le_and_incl_implies_dup_or_perm is completelly
      rewritten (including some of the improvements of RM) to flatten/shorten it.

Line 269, identify_duplicates_from_dup/dup_from_duplicates replaced by
      list_has_dup_eq_duplicates on line 58

Line 294, finite_pigeon_hole now as a very short proof 

*****************
File utils.v
*****************

Line 86--120 zip et al now moved to zip.v
   added zip_app_left_le and zip_app_right_le from RM 
   further simplified proofs of zip_app_left and zip_app_right.

Line 121 the proof of zip_spec: I did not import the change tactic which is
   only usefull for the human eye

Line 166 & 173, included the comment about map_concat and map_zip

Line 181, indeed why not the type indication here (which contradicts my
   above remark/statement about implicit types ;-)

Line 190, no change tactic
Line 193, clear IH is unnecessary

Line 215-, section app moved to list_utils.v

Line 288-, section Forall2 moved to list_utils.v

Line 291, type info on l & m unnecessary, enforcing my above remark 
    (don't be crazy about the inherent contradiction in human taste)

Line 294, Forall2_zip_app moved to zip.v ... names of bounded variable l[12] and m[12]
    is also a matter of taste ...
