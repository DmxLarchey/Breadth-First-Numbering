Require Import List Extraction.
Require Import bt fifo bfn_fifo.

Extraction Language OCaml.
Extract Inductive bool => "bool" [ "true" "false" ].
Extract Inductive prod => "(*)"  [ "(,)" ].
Extract Inductive list => "list" [ "[]" "(::)" ].
Extract Inductive nat => int [ "0" "succ" ] "(fun fO fS n -> if n=0 then fO () else fS (n-1))".

(* Depending on the content of fifo.v, the extraction here provides either
   1) an empty implementation of FIFOs (with fifo_axm)
   2) a trivial implementation with lists (with fifo_triv)
   3) an implementation with 2 lists and efficient reverse (with fifo_2lists), (relaxed) O(1) enqueue/dequeue
   4) an implementation with 3 lazy lists (with fifo_3llists), O(1) enqueue/dequeue
 *)
